/**
 * Integration Tests for Provider Loading (RED PHASE)
 * 
 * These tests verify the end-to-end behavior of the provider factory system.
 * In the RED phase, these tests should FAIL because the full integration
 * between the monkey patch and the opencode Provider system isn't implemented yet.
 * 
 * The tests define the expected behavior that will guide implementation:
 * 
 * 1. Provider Factory Loading: When a providerFactory is configured, the system
 *    should use the factory to create providers instead of the default SDK
 * 
 * 2. Model Caching: Loaded models should be cached in the Provider state Map
 *    to avoid redundant factory calls
 * 
 * 3. SDK Bypass: When providerFactory exists, the original getModel/getSDK
 *    path should be bypassed entirely
 * 
 * 4. Factory Logging: All factory operations should include "source: custom-factory"
 *    markers in the logs for debugging and monitoring
 * 
 * Current Status (RED PHASE):
 * - Monkey patch fails to import Provider module (expected)
 * - No provider factory mechanism is active
 * - No model caching occurs
 * - No factory-specific logging happens
 * 
 * When GREEN phase is implemented, all these tests should pass.

/**
 * RED PHASE TEST RESULTS SUMMARY:
 * 
 * ✗ loads codex models via providerFactory
 *   - FAILS: providerModuleAvailable is false (expected true)
 *   - Reason: Provider module import fails, no integration exists
 * 
 * ✗ caches loaded models in state Map  
 *   - FAILS: Cannot access Provider.state() method
 *   - Reason: Provider module not available, no caching mechanism
 * 
 * ✗ uses custom factory instead of getSDK
 *   - FAILS: isPatchApplied() returns false (expected true)
 *   - Reason: Monkey patch not applied due to import failure
 * 
 * ✗ logging includes custom-factory marker
 *   - FAILS: No factory logging occurred
 *   - Reason: No factory operations happen without working patch
 * 
 * These failures define the integration work needed for GREEN phase:
 * 1. Establish working Provider module import/integration
 * 2. Apply monkey patch successfully 
 * 3. Enable factory-based model loading
 * 4. Implement proper caching in Provider state
 * 5. Add factory-specific logging markers
